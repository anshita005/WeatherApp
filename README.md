# Weather App

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the weather forecast for different cities. Users can input the name of a city and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The app also provides background images based on the current temperature to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: View the current weather conditions for a specific city, including temperature, humidity, cloud percentage, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset.
- **Background Images**: The background image of the app changes dynamically based on the temperature of the selected city, providing a visual representation of the weather conditions.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can input the name of a city and click on the search button to fetch the weather forecast for that city.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and interactivity.
- **Fetch API**: Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests to the weather API and retrieve weather data.
- **RapidAPI**: RapidAPI is used as the backend service to fetch weather data based on the city name.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Usage
